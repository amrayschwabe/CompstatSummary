\section{Cross validation}
\textbf{LOOCV} $\theta_{LOOCV} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat f^{-i}(x_i))^2$
\textbf{k-fold} $\theta_k = 1/k\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{size fold}\sum_{size fold}(y_i-\hat f_k))^2$ where $f_k$ only has been trained on all folds without the k'th fold. 
\textbf{Double crossvalidation: }Split data into training and test. Then split training again in training and test and do crossvalidation to find best model. Then test your best model on the first training/test split. 
\textbf{get folds in R: } \begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
folds <- sample(cut(c(1:nr_data), breaks = nr_folds, labels = F), nr_data, replace = F) 
out_fold <- data[folds == i]
in_fold <- data[folds != i]
\end{lstlisting}
